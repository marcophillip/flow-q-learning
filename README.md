 * Environment configuration changed from AntMaze to HalfCheetah.
 * 
 * Note: This change was made because AntMaze has sparse rewards,
 * which can make training difficult and slow. HalfCheetah provides
 * denser reward signals for more effective learning.
 

## Offline Experiments

To run the offline experiments, execute the following command in the training folder:
